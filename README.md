# Parallax Baseball UI

A demonstration of a parallax applied to a baseball being thrown by a pitcher. Although the parallax effect works, the spin of the baseball doesn't accurately reflect how a baseball would be thrown (a curve ball's direction of rotation is starting from the top of the baseball spinning downward directly toward the batter).
